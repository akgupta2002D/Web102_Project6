        <p>
          This project is a data dashboard built using React. It showcases the use of React Router, data
          fetching from the Open Library API, and dynamic visualizations using Recharts. The dashboard allows
          users to filter books based on publishing years and explore detailed views for each book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was developed as part of CodePath's Intermediate Web Development course and demonstrates modern
          front-end development techniques with a clean, responsive design.
